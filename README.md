# DataViz
## Summary
This repo contains the queries, datasets, and files I used to create various data visualizations. Each folder contains all the files corresponding to a visualization, complete with a SQL file for all queries used to retrieve and clean the data, a folder containing all the datasets used, as well as files corresponding to the visualization (e.g. a pbix and pdf file for Power BI visualizations).

All datasets are also available at: https://www.kaggle.com/isaacwen/datasets
